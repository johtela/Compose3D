# Useful Extensions for .NET Types

This assembly contains useful extension methods and helper classes for standard .NET types. They have 
came in handy in many projects I have authored in the past. So, I gave them a home in their own assembly 
and created a nuget package for it.

The extension classes are listed below with links to their documentation. The documentation is generated
with the [Literate Programming](https://johtela.github.io/LiterateProgramming) tool I have written.
